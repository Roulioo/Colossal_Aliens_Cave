# Colossal_Aliens_Cave

Labyrinth games in the terminal. The goal is to move in a labyrinth not knowing the position of the aliens and the exit. You have to face the two aliens and kill them. When both aliens are dead, head for the exit and the game is won.

The different commands are explained when the game is initialized. Here is an example of a labyrinth used.
The letters A1 and A2 correspond to the aliens and D at the exit.

    ["_","A1","D"]
    ["A2","_","_"]
